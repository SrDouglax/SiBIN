# Moleculab

## Description
The Moleculab is a JavaScript-based simulation tool that allows users to visualize molecular structures and simulate interactions between nodes. It provides features for creating nodes, forming bonds between them, calculating angles, and visualizing molecular configurations.

## Installation
To use the Moleculab, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run with `pnpm dev`.

## Usage
Once the simulation is running, you can interact with it using the mouse and keyboard:
- Click on the canvas to create nodes.
- Press and hold the CTRL key while clicking on nodes to form bonds between them.
- Press the 'n' key to create a new random node at the current mouse position.
- Press the 'd' key to delete the node under the mouse cursor.

## Features
- Visualization of molecular structures.
- Creation of nodes and formation of bonds between them.
- Calculation and visualization of angles between nodes.
- Interactive simulation with mouse and keyboard controls.
